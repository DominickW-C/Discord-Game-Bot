A discord bot that I made over the summer between my Freshman and Sophmore
year of college. There are three different features it has, including RPS, 
a dice roller, and a hangman game. One big feature I implemented about the 
hangman game is it uses a text file to save your progess even if the bot 
ends up turning off. Might go back and add a feature so it won't let you
guess the same letter twice. For a list of the commands you can give the 
bot, type "!help" in discord while it is running. You will have to implement
your own token to get this running (in discordBotMain.py add to token var).

Things this project helped me learn: 
    - using different python files together
    - using a text file as a save
    - decorators and how they work
